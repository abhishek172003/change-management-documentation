    John Kotter, a renowned leadership and change management expert, introduced an 8-Step Process for Leading Change. This model provides a structured approach for organizations to effectively navigate and implement change initiatives. Here are the eight steps in detail:

    Establishing a Sense of Urgency: Create a compelling case for change by highlighting the reasons why change is necessary. This step aims to foster a sense of urgency among stakeholders, motivating them to support and actively participate in the change initiative.

    Example: A technology company emphasizes the rapidly evolving industry landscape, the emergence of new competitors, and the need to stay ahead in innovation.

    Forming a Powerful Guiding Coalition: Assemble a diverse and influential group of leaders who can champion the change effort. This coalition should have the credibility, skills, and authority to drive the change across the organization.
    
    •	Key Activities:

     - Identify and recruit influential leaders from various levels and departments.

     - Ensure the coalition has a mix of skills, expertise, and representation.
